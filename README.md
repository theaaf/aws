# aws [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theaaf/aws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theaaf/aws)

This is where general purpose AWS infrastructure components that The Alliance uses lives. It's open sourced in hopes that others may find it useful. In each directory, you'll find a README describing the functionality and deployment method for each component (in most cases, a CloudFormation template and a description of its parameters).

## Pull Requests

Pull requests that fix bugs, increase resiliency, or improve documentation are very welcome. Pull requests that add features aren't something we're generally open to, but if you think you have a feature that we might be interested in anyway, feel free to open an issue to discuss it. And if you have a fork of any component with useful features, let us know and we may be willing to link to it from a README.
